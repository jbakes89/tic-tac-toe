# Tic-Tac-Toe

Author: Joseph Bakes (created on 3rd June, 2021)

## Description
An app that lets you play Tic Tac Toe between two people, built as part of The Odin Project Full Stack Javascript Course.

Note: Since this was a learning exercise, I've avoided using certain patterns (e.g., ES6 classes, modules). The intention of this project was to practice the use of the IIFE module pattern and factories.

### Things I've learned/practised:
- Improving appearance of website on mobile devices
- Creating a coherent, scalable, fluid appearance
- Structuring code into suitable objects

### Things to add/improve:

### Patch Notes (20th June, 2021)
- Back to work after childbirth
- Built a `colorFactory` to handle conversions between colour formats (RGB vs Hex)

### TODO (20th June, 2021)
- Allow players to edit their names and change colour
    - Build an 'edit players' menu to set player name, colour, and (later) type (human or cpu)
- Setup players based on current player info when resetting game
- Add a display to show the game outcome
- Set appropriate text colour depending on player choice of background colour
- Add a running tally of game wins
- Build a computer opponent
- Allow players to use custom markers?
- Allow players to change the grid size/win condition?
