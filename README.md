# Tic-Tac-Toe

Author: Joseph Bakes (created on 3rd June, 2021)

## Description
An app that lets you play Tic Tac Toe between two people, built as part of The Odin Project Full Stack Javascript Course.

Note: Since this was a learning exercise, I've avoided using certain patterns (e.g., ES6 classes, modules). The intention of this project was to practice the use of the IIFE module pattern and factories.

Note: This project was severly interrupted by the birth of my wonderful children. Between the time spent in hospital and the time taking care of my wife at home after the delivery, I wasn't able to work on this project properly for around 3 weeks.

### Things I've learned/practised:
- Improving appearance of website on mobile devices
- Creating a coherent, scalable, fluid appearance
- Structuring code into suitable objects
- Handling colours (specifically, formulae for setting text colour of suitable contrast and for determining similarity between two colours)

### Things to add/improve:
- Build a computer opponent
- Enable custom markers
- Allow players to set a custom grid size and the number of consecutive markers required for victory
- Add a match history

### Patch Notes (1st July, 2021)
- Added automatic resizing of player names.
- Added indication of current player's turn (tile hover color and change in player name border).

### TODO (1st July, 2021)
- Add a display to show the game outcome
