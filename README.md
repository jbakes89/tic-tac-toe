# Tic-Tac-Toe

Author: Joseph Bakes (created on 3rd June, 2021)

## Description
An app that lets you play Tic Tac Toe between two people, built as part of The Odin Project Full Stack Javascript Course.

Note: Since this was a learning exercise, I've avoided using certain patterns (e.g., ES6 classes, modules). The intention of this project was to practice the use of the IIFE module pattern and factories.

### Things I've learned/practised:
