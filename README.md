# Tic-Tac-Toe

Author: Joseph Bakes (created on 3rd June, 2021)

## Description
An app that lets you play Tic Tac Toe between two people, built as part of The Odin Project Full Stack Javascript Course.

Note: Since this was a learning exercise, I've avoided using certain patterns (e.g., ES6 classes, modules). The intention of this project was to practice the use of the IIFE module pattern and factories.

### Things I've learned/practised:

### Things to add/improve:

- Set up the grid and a few basic functions, while starting to flesh out the structure of the main modules.

- Function to check win condition (n-in-a-row)
- Show player names
- Allow players to edit their names
- Add a display to show the game outcome
- Build a computer opponent
- Allow players to use custom markers?
- Allow players to change the grid size/win condition?
